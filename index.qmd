I'm Mallory Giesie.

I am currently pursuing my Master's of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. For my master's capstone my team will be working to use meteorological data in order to develop various climate scenarios which will be used to model future fire regimes in the California Central Coast. I made my way to Santa Barbara after completing my Bachelor's degree at the American University of Paris in Quantitative Environmental Science. For my undergraduate thesis I simulated and analyzed a co-evolution experiment that I was lucky enough to assist on at the University of Konstanz. My goal is to continue to use data to assist in environmental exploration and problem solving. I'll be updating this website as I continue throughout my journey!
