I'm Mallory! An environmental data scientist leveraging data and technology to innovate in the climate and sustainability sector.

After receiving my graduate degree in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management I began my current role at ICF as a Climate Change & Sustainability Technology Specialist. A lot of the data products I'm creating currently aid in better quantifying greenhouse gas emissions and aiding in mitigation strategies

I love to collaborate with others in the environmental space to develop tools and processes that allow scientists and the general population to get the most out of all the data we have available.
