I'm Mallory Giesie.

My adventure in environmental data science began at the American University of Paris, where I pursued a degree in quantitative environmental science and computer science. During my undergraduate years, I had the opportunity to be involved in ecological research at the University of Konstanz in Germany - pictured here :) This experience, a blend of lab work and data analysis, inspired me to pursue a master's degree in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.\
\
At Bren, my skills really took shape and my excitement to dive into the field found its footing. For my master's capstone we partnered with the [Tague Team lab](https://www.tagueteamlab.com) in a larger project supported by the Moore Foundation to automate the integration of unique climate scenarios into their ecohydrological modeling, optimizing their workflow with the latest climate science for enhanced accuracy. You can take a look at our Github repository [here](https://github.com/fire-futures).


As a recent graduate, I am eager to find a role where I can apply these skills and make a meaningful impact. I'll update this website with all my projects as I go!
