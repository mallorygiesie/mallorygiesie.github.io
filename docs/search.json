    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction:\nThe Arctic Sea, once an area nearly impenetrable, has become a new playground for shipping and tourism alike. This is impart due to advances in ships and navigation allowing safer passage to areas once completely isolated. More importantly, and what this analysis is meant to reflect, is the effect climate change has had on ice extent which has allowed for more ships to voyage, more months out of the year throughout the arctic. It has been reported that between the years 2013 and 2019 the number of ships entering the Arctic Polar Code grew by 25%. (Arctic Council). In 2017, The Polar Code was enacted by the International Maritime Organization providing framework for safely navigating polar waters while adhering to environmental protocol. The region is under a time of immense change, and understanding ship traffic patterns is integral to assessing potential increased destruction to the area.\nMy Data\nNorth Pacific and Arctic Marine Vessel Traffic Dataset (2015-2020); Hexagon Data\nTo frame my question I will primarily be using satellite collected data tracking unique ship observations in the Pacific Arctic sector which extends from the Aleutian Islands through Bering Sea and into the southern Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.\nThe data was collected monthly between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2020. To calculate shipping intensity, they used an Automatic Identification System data collected from all ships over 300 gross tonnes on an international voyage, all cargo ships over 500 gross tonnes, and all passenger ships. They then converted the AIS data into a monthly hex data set which I downloaded as vector data. I chose to focus on the monthly sum of unique ships (both cargo and passenger) in the region.\nVisualized Hex Data\n\n\nCode\n`2015-01` <- `2015-01` |>  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))\n  \n`2015-04` <- `2015-04` |> mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))\n  \n`2015-07` <- `2015-07` |> mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))\n  \n`2015-10` <- `2015-10` |>  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))\n  \n\njan <- tm_shape(`2015-01`) +\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"nMMSI_A\",\n    palette = \"viridis\",\n    title = \"Number of Unique Ships\",\n    breaks = c(0,1,100,200,300,400,500)\n  ) + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, title = \"January 2015\")\n\n\napr <- tm_shape(`2015-04`) +\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"nMMSI_A\",\n    palette = \"viridis\",\n    title = \"Number of Unique Ships\",\n    breaks = c(0,1,100,200,300,400,500)\n  ) + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, title = \"April 2015\")\n\njuly  <- tm_shape(`2015-07`) +\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"nMMSI_A\",\n    palette = \"viridis\",\n    title = \"Number of Unique Ships\",\n    breaks = c(0,1,100,200,300,400,500)\n  ) + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, title = \"July 2015\")\n\noct <- tm_shape(`2015-10`) +\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"nMMSI_A\",\n    palette = \"viridis\",\n    title = \"Number of Unique Ships\",\n    breaks = c(0,1,100,200,300,400,500)\n  ) + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE, title = \"October 2015\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Bulletin: Arctic Sea Ice Extent Anomalies\nI also utilized sea ice anomaly data from Copernicus Climate Change data base which uses ECMWF’s (European Center for Medium Weather Forecasts) ERA-Interim reanalysis of observations. For the data I utilized the calculation for absolute sea ice area (SIA) anomaly in millions sq km.\nMy Analysis plan\n1. Time Series Analysis\nI wanted to look at the changes in ship traffic over time and how these may change given the part of region of the data set we were looking at. To do this I split my data up into north and south and ran decomposition to understand the underlying trends. I also ran this on the sea ice anomaly data (see appendix)\n2. Regression Analysis\nI wanted to understand what factors determine the number of ships sited in a given month. To do this I summed each hex value to determine the amount of vessels registered per month. I split these up to north and south and ran a linear regression with sea ice anomaly, year, and season (first or last half of the year) as my predicting variables.\nI then combined the data sets and ran a linear regression which now included region (north or south) as a predictor of monthly ship numbers.\nThen finally I included an interaction to see if the effect of the season depends on the region.\nMy Results\nDecomposition\n\n\nCode\nall_years<- do.call(rbind, df_geom) |>\n  tibble::rownames_to_column(\"Cycle\") |>\n  mutate(hexID = str_sub(Cycle, 9)) |>\n  mutate(Cycle = str_sub(Cycle, 1, 7)) |> \n  select(-hexID) |>\n  pivot_wider(names_from = 'Cycle',\n              values_from = 'nMMSI_A') |> \n  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0))\n\nsouth <- all_years |> slice(0:3500)\nnorth <- all_years |> slice(3501:6553)\nsouth <- st_drop_geometry(south)\nyearly_totals <- colSums(south, na.rm=T)\ntraffic_ts_south <- ts(yearly_totals, frequency=4, start=c(2015,1))\n\n#plot.ts(traffic_ts_south)\n\ntraffic_ts_south <- as_tsibble(traffic_ts_south)\n\nsouth_time <- traffic_ts_south  %>%\n  model(\n    classical_decomposition(value, type = \"additive\")\n  ) %>%\n  components() %>%\n  autoplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Decomposition of Ship Traffic in the Arctic: Bering sea from 2015-2021\")\n\nnorth <- st_drop_geometry(north)\nyearly_totals <- colSums(north, na.rm=T)\ntraffic_ts_north<- ts(yearly_totals, frequency=4, start=c(2015,1))\n#plot.ts(traffic_ts_north)\n\ntraffic_ts_north <- as_tsibble(traffic_ts_north)\n\nnorth_time <- traffic_ts_north  %>%\n  model(\n    classical_decomposition(value, type = \"additive\")\n  ) %>%\n  components() %>%\n  autoplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Decomposition of Ship Traffic in the Arctic: Northern Bering and Southern Chukchi and Beaufort Seas from 2015-2021\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these two figures you can see the difference ways seasonal and yearly trends play in the northern and southerns regions of our data set. The number of ships seen in the northern region, is much more dependent on the season than the southern. This makes sense, because the ice is much denser in the earlier half of the year. We can see from the visualization of our data, it is rare to see many ships travel far north in January and April. This also plays into the intuition why the yearly trend for the northern portion of the data is stronger too. As sea ice melts, the are where we will see more and more ship traffic will be the northern polar areas where it was once barricaded by ice.\nRegression\n\n\nCode\njuly_anomaly <- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, \"july_anomaly.csv\")) |> slice(37:42) |> dplyr::select(Date, X.SIA.anomaly)\noct_anomaly <- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, \"oct_anomaly.csv\")) |> slice(37:42) |> dplyr::select(Date, X.SIA.anomaly)\njanuary_anomaly <- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, \"january_anomaly.csv\")) |> slice(37:42) |> dplyr::select(Date, X.SIA.anomaly)\napril_anomaly <- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, \"april_anomaly.csv\")) |> slice(37:42) |> dplyr::select(Date, X.SIA.anomaly)\n\nanomaly_south <- rbind(july_anomaly,oct_anomaly,april_anomaly,january_anomaly) |> arrange(Date) |> cbind(traffic_ts_south) |> dplyr::select(-index) |> dplyr::rename(Extent = X.SIA.anomaly, Value = value) |> mutate(Date = lubridate::ym(Date)) |> mutate(Year = lubridate::year(Date), Month = lubridate::month(Date)) |> mutate(Month = as.factor(Month)) |> mutate(Season = ifelse(Month == 1 | Month == 4, \"First_Half\", \"Last_half\")) |> mutate(Season = as.factor(Season))\n\nanomaly_north <- rbind(july_anomaly,oct_anomaly,april_anomaly,january_anomaly) |> arrange(Date) |> cbind(traffic_ts_north) |> dplyr::select(-index) |> dplyr::rename(Extent = X.SIA.anomaly, Value = value) |> mutate(Date = lubridate::ym(Date)) |> mutate(Year = lubridate::year(Date), Month = lubridate::month(Date)) |> mutate(Month = as.factor(Month)) |> mutate(Season = ifelse(Month == 1 | Month == 4, \"First_Half\", \"Last_half\")) |> mutate(Season = as.factor(Season))\n\n\nTo begin, I ran regression to predict monthly ship observations in the southern region of my dataset (see appendix) The only predictor that had a significant effect on amount of ships seen monthly in the southern region of our data set was year. The intercept was nonsensical but the model predicts that each year ship sightings grow by an estimated 1,492 ships.\nI then ran regression to predict monthly ship observations in the northern region as you can see below.\n\\[\nNorthernShipCount = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * Year_i + \\beta_1 * Season_i + \\beta_1 * Ice Extent + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\n\nCode\nmod <- lm(Value ~ abs(Extent) + Year + Season, data = anomaly_north)\nmod %>%\n  tbl_regression(intercept= TRUE) %>%\n  as_gt() %>%\n  gt::tab_source_note(gt::md(\"*Kelly Kapsar, Benjamin Sullender, and Aaron Poe. 2022.
